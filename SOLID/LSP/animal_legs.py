Liskov Substitution Principle

A sub-class must be substitutable for its super-class.
The aim of this principle is to ascertain that a sub-class can assume the place of its super-class without errors.
If the code finds itself checking the type of class then, it must have violated this principle.
Letâ€™s use our Animal example.
